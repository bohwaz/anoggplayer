Based on Arek Korbik's FOGG reference implementation, http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~arkadini/fogg/trunk/files.

Player is capable of natively playing Ogg Vorbis files and webcasts, up to 128 kbps, at 44100 Hz, using Flash v.10 plugin.

Update: higher bandwidth ogg files are now supported, limited to 44100 Hz

Adaptation of other formats is planned as well.

All user interface is pure javascript, to control the player completely from the hosting web-page.

The player is written in haXe (http://haxe.org) for flash.
